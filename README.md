# Implementing the control of the pendulum
This repository contains the code used in Boise State University to control a simple pendulum.
The pendulum is made of a rod and a bob which is actuated with a Maxon RE35 motor connected to a gearhead with a 4.3:1 reduction.

The motor is driven with an ESCON 50/5 microcontroller which is commanded by the computer through an MBED microprocessor. The communication between the computer and the MBED is accomplished through serial port.
